A collection of statistical emulators for the UCLCHEM and RADEX astronomical codes. The UCLCHEM emulators can be used to obtain chemical abundances for various molecules under varying physical conditions. The RADEX emulator can be used to estimate the strength of molecular lines. Both emulators are built using neural networks. For more detail on the emulation procedure and its applications, please refer to the associated paper (put paper). If you end up using this code in published work, you can cite it as follows:
