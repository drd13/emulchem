To use emulchem in a project::

    import emulchem
    
emulchem is a very simple modules that contains two different components. An astrochemical emulator for most molecules and a RADEX emulator for a select few molecules. The RADEX emulator is mostly intended for quick testing, we do not recommend using it in full projects.
